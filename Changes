    * There's a new extensible send policy framework for helping authors build
      bots that are prevented from doing really annoying things like being too
      chatty, repeating themselves too often, etc.
    * Send policies will be applied in all cases to chats and chat consumers
      automatically. They are not yet applied to dispatched services.
    * A new send_policy sugar method is available via Bot::Backbone to configure
      send policies.
    * Two send policy models are provided: (1) MinimumInterval to prevent
      general flooding and (2) MinimumRepeatInterval to prevent the bot from
      repeating itself.
    * ConsoleChat now has get_line and put_line methods to allow easier
      interaction with the terminal.
    * Bugfix: The respond sugar subroutine was completely unusable.
    * Bugfix: Previously, JabberChat would fail if a message was sent through it
      before the session was completely ready. Now a warning is issued instead.
    * Bugfix: JabberChat is no longer XMPP spewing debug output to STDOUT.
    * Bugfix: Group chats that start with the bots nick were being incorrectly
      picked up by the DirectChat service.
    * Bugfix: Sometimes Jabber servers send messages with no message.
      AnyEvent::XMPP passes these on for some reason. We ignore them now because
      they were causing the Bot::Backbone::Message constructor to craok.
    * Bugfix: A few documentation tweaks and other small fixes.
